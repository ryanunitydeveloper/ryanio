title: 'Unity Project - Extension Methods'
caption: I use this package in quite a few of my projects. This package in particular is focused on extension methods within the Unity environment.
description: >
  Extension methods are static methods that define additional functionality in a particular class. This is useful when you want to extend an existing type that is in another namespace or project. This project focuses utilizing C#'s support for extension methods. Somme examples are: adding support to further modify game object state, manipulation of game objects not already defined in the public Unity API, a more efficient 'HasFlag' check for enums, and various methods for other third party assets that I use in my Unity projects. See the GitHub repository for examples.
