## A* Pathfinding Project
<p class="tab">This is a must-have alternative to Unity's NavMesh system. The Astarpathfing project is one of the most complete and powerful third party asset I have found on the Unity Asset Store</p>
<p class="tab">Aron is a very active & helpful developer. The documentation is terrific and there are a number of examples & tutorials to walk through. Aron also keeps up with the latest Untiy tech stack. For example, in his newester versions, you can now "jobify" graph generation with Unity's job system.</p>
<p class ="tab">I've not gone into much detail on what this asset can offer you. Please visit the link below to learn more </p>
<p class="tab">** I am <b><i>NOT</b></i> a sponsor for this asset **
