## Sebastian Lague
<p class="tab"> I can't recommend Sebastian's content enough... if you really want to feel the woes of <a href="internalFile.md" class="internal-link">Imposter Syndrone</a>, then look no further. Sebastian has a brilliant mind. Pair that with his natural gift as an orator & teacher, and he is a winning combination for anyone looking to further develop their skills as a Unity & C# developer.</p>
<p class="tab">
My <a href="procedural-generation-overview.md" class="internal-link">procedural level generator</a> is based off some of Sebastian's YouTube playlist for procdural generation. Sebastian goes into detail on his thought process behind his design. <br><br>
He will introduce you to a number of algorithms and gives  a brief explanation as he implements them. <br><br>
I <b><i>highly</b></i> recommend watching some (or all) of Sebastian's content. Try and replicate some of he implementations & ideas Sebastian talks about.<br><br> I'd recommend to do some side reserach on any algorithm he uses. It's best to familiarize yourself with them to truly understand why he chose the algorithm that he did.
