## Whinarm's Unity Mesh Simplifier
<p class="tab">I found this asset through the GameDevGuru website. My procedural generator creates and serializes meshes with tens-of-thousands of veritces & triangles. I do not need that level of resolution/fidelity within these meshes. In order to improve performance, I did some research and experimentation with this asset on Whinarm's GitHub page. Check it out. If you have complex meshes, this little tool did a wonderful job of 'simplifying' mine.</p>
