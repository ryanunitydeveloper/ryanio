# Project  
___
## Description
<p>One of the goals for Omni was to have quasi-procedurally generated levels (maps, worlds, etc.) that the player(s) and NPCs can interact with. Once a 'base' for a level has been established (by generation), manually processing the level to include details and make the level more conrugent in how it flows is essential.</P>
